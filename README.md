reminders
- to deploy R3 and R4 schedules, use branches `ix-r3` and `ix-r4` respectively
- the R2 and R3 schedules have a slight amount of overlap in July. Thus, you should look at Qgenda as well when planning the R3 schedule to make sure that you are not putting someone in conflicting shifts
- the naming of these cells between sheets needs to be identical or there will be issues:
  - column headers (especially, "name") 
  - resident names between sheets
